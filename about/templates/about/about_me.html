    {% trans "Welcome to the site! Before I dive into the deep stuff (and I promise, I will, but bear with me), let’s talk about the Team—because honestly, they're the real MVPs here. I'm just one of the four members. I am a mature woman (yes, \"mature\" is the polite way to say “I’m not a spring chicken anymore”), I’m a lesbian, and – wait for it – I’m a Christian. But here’s the fun part: The other three members of the team? God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Yes, you read that right. No typo." %} <br>

    {% trans "Now, before you click away thinking, “Uh-oh, this is definitely not my vibe,” I get it. You might fall into one of these categories:" %} <hr>

    1. {% trans "You don’t believe in God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit (Hopefully you will stick around and change that, because God believes in you)." %} <br>
    2. {% trans "You believe, but you might be wondering, “Can a lesbian really be a Christian?” (Spoiler alert: Absolutely!)" %} <br>
    3. {% trans "You’re just not here for this entire conversation (I’ll send you virtual hugs, and I totally understand if this is not your jam)." %} <hr>

    {% trans "But if you’re still with me, I’m glad you’re here. And I promise I’ll take you on a journey you didn’t expect. You see, I grew up in a quiet little town in the heart of nowhere Africa. It was peaceful, we had all the basics—food, a roof over our heads, and a sense of comfort. But... Sundays were a bit of a drag. Like most kids in my country, I was dragged to church, even though I couldn’t figure out why I had to go. It was just what you did. But here’s the thing – I also knew early on that I was gay. And in that little town, where conservative values were in full swing, being gay wasn’t exactly “the vibe.” Add Sundays into the mix, and I found myself super confused. What’s worse? My church wasn’t exactly rolling out the rainbow carpet. I began wondering, “Does God really love me? Is it even okay to be gay AND believe in God?” Spoiler #2: I had no clue, and neither did most people I met. Fast forward to now, and I’m on a mission to give a different answer: YES, God loves us all! Whether you're gay, straight, bi, or somewhere in between, you are loved. If you’ve ever been told that God doesn’t love you because of your sexuality, then this website was made for you. I want to show you a different side of faith—one that embraces ALL people, just as they are. So, here’s what this website is all about:" %} <hr>

    <br>
    <strong>{% trans "The Mission:" %}</strong> {% trans "The mission is simple (but profound): Share my thoughts, growth, and insights as a gay Christian and show that faith and sexuality don’t have to be at odds. By doing so, I hope to help others feel that they, too, can be loved by God – exactly as they are." %} <hr>

    <strong>{% trans "The Five Values of this Website:" %}</strong>
    <br><br>

    1. {% trans "Love First, Judge Never" %} <br>
    {% trans "This site is about one thing—love. No judgments, no \"who's in\" and \"who's out.\" Just pure, unfiltered love, the kind that welcomes everyone." %} <br><br><br>

    2. {% trans "Acceptance Over Rejection" %} <br>
    {% trans "I want to help people who feel rejected by their faith to see that God doesn’t turn away from them. Ever. We’re all welcome here, just as we are." %} <br><br><br>

    3. {% trans "Honesty, Even When It’s Tough" %} <br>
    {% trans "I’m not going to sugar-coat it. Life is hard, faith can be confusing, and sometimes, it feels like the world doesn’t get us. But honesty—raw, real honesty—will always be our guiding star." %} <br><br><br>

    4. {% trans "Growth Through Faith" %} <br>
    {% trans "This site is a place to explore, question, and grow. Whether you’re just starting to find your way back to God or you’ve always been on this journey, we’re in this together. Growth is a messy, beautiful process!" %} <br><br><br>

    5. {% trans "Hope That’s Bigger Than Fear" %} <br>
    {% trans "Fear tries to hold us back. Fear of rejection, fear of not being enough, fear of stepping into the unknown. But the hope we find in faith is so much bigger than any fear. And here, that hope is always in abundance." %} <br><br><br>

    {% trans "So, whether you’re here because you’re curious, you’re looking for some comfort, or you just want to explore a different way of viewing faith and sexuality, I’m thrilled you found your way to this website. God loves us ALL—rainbow flags and all—and that’s the truth I’m here to share. Take a seat, stay for a while, and let’s have some real, honest conversations about God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit... and everything in between." %}
